# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I am grasping it pretty well after all the challenges/assignments. At first, I was a bit confused that I needed my if statement variable to also have the `[i]` after, but figured that out when it didn't work for me a few times. Talking to my 'rubber duck' helped me out.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I productively struggled a bit. I actually went to message a good friend for a bit of outside help, and literally as I messaged him while thinking about the problem, I thought of a potential solution that worked. He recommended I use my 'rubber duck' more often since it's helpful to walk through and explain your problem as a step toward solving it.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I want to learn more about calling array methods and how they work in different situations. They seem like useful tools, but I've yet to fully grasp how some of them will be practically used.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I plan to do some extra reading on both for statements and array methods. I'll likely look at stack overflow or MDN to get some more ideas on how those can be used. Sometimes it's challenging to read code you don't really yet know, so I sometimes look up each small piece of code and translate it so I can read it better. Sometimes it's just too complicated for me to grasp quickly or at all, so starting small or more simple is something I will try to do.
